# Application server
Also called an app server, an application server is a program on a computer  that handles all application operations between users and an organization’s backend business applications or databases.

An application server is typically used for complex transaction-based applications. To support high-end needs like heavy traffic and complex requests, an application server has to have built-in redundancy, monitor for high-availability, high-performance distributed application services, and support for complex database access. 

WHAT IS AN APPLICATION SERVER?
An application server provides web pages or application content that is dynamic or allows complex user interactions. Dynamic content is more interactive and involved than static content; it changes regularly due to end user manipulation:

E-commerce fields
Suggested items on Internet shops, which are dynamically repopulated based on end user behavior and current promotions
Real-time business intelligence and analytics
Real-time user data, such as location or weather information
Back-end content management systems
In contrast, static content generally doesn’t change unless it is manually edited by the site owner (a blog article, for example).

Application servers:
- Use multiple protocols, including HTTP, the most common web protocol, and IIOP/SSL, which increases the number of programs which which the servers can share business logic
- Use multi-threading, which adds speed and efficiency to computing processes because multiple threads can run concurrently
- Implement business logic, which manages rules for data behavior within software

HOW DO APPLICATION SERVERS WORK?
Application servers work as an intermediary between databases, which store application data, and web clients. They also communicate with web servers, which deliver content to the web client.

Application servers and web servers both communicate using servlets, which are server-side Java classes that process web server requests and return a response. Servlets are used to return dynamic web content to web pages; they process complex requests and transform data from the database. Servlets cost less than Common Gateway Interface (CGI) scripting, another server extension, and they directly connect to the server where CGI does not.
